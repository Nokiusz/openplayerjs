This is a media player that uses all the goods of HTML5 video/audio elements to play the most popular media in MP4/MP3, HLS and M(PEG)-DASH, and also has the ability to play VMAP, VAST and VPAID ads.

## Advantages

* Supports **IE11+ (Win8) and all modern browsers**.
* **No dependencies**, since it is written in Typescript.
* Runs a simple but yet powerful algorithm to **check the browser's autoplay capabilities** across browsers.
* Supports for **local and remote captions** for **both video and audio**, even without including the `crossorigin` attribute.
* **Enhance your player** adding your own buttons. Check [here](./docs/customize.md) for more details.
* Provides the ability to use a **single VAST/VPAID** source or a **VAST/VPAID playlist** from several different sources (including URLs and valid XML strings).
* **Can play ads in infinite loop**, desired for ads that are in a heavy text page.
* Always **responsive** by default, for both video/audio tags; for video, **`fill`** and **`fit`** modes are available to either scale and crop media relative to its parent container, or to attempt to make the media fit its parent container (including black bars), respectively.
